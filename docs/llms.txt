# nvschooldata

Fetch and analyze Nevada school enrollment data from
[NVDOE](https://doe.nv.gov/offices/office-of-assessment-data-and-accountability-management-adam/accountability/data-requests/enrollment-for-nevada-public-schools)
in R or Python.

## Why nvschooldata?

This package is part of the [State Schooldata
Project](https://github.com/almartin82/njschooldata), which provides
simple, consistent interfaces for accessing state-published school data.
The original [njschooldata](https://github.com/almartin82/njschooldata)
package for New Jersey inspired this 50-state effort to make state
education data accessible without manual downloads or data wrangling.

**What’s available:** 10 years of enrollment data (2016-2026) covering
500,000+ students across 17 school districts and the State Public
Charter School Authority. Demographic breakdowns include race/ethnicity,
gender, and special populations (EL, FRL, IEP).

## 15 Insights from Nevada Enrollment Data

### 1. Nevada’s enrollment has plateaued after decades of growth

Nevada was one of America’s fastest-growing states for decades, but
school enrollment has flattened in recent years. The COVID era marked a
turning point.

``` r
library(nvschooldata)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Note: 2025 data temporarily unavailable from NDE
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(c(2021:2024, 2026), use_cache = TRUE)

state_totals <- enr |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  group_by(end_year) |>
  summarize(n_students = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  mutate(change = n_students - lag(n_students),
         pct_change = round(change / lag(n_students) * 100, 2))

### 2. Clark County is Nevada’s education giant

Clark County School District (Las Vegas metro) is the 5th largest school
district in America, enrolling over 60% of all Nevada students.

``` r
enr_2026 <- fetch_enr(2026, use_cache = TRUE)

top_districts <- enr_2026 |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>

### 3. Nevada’s demographic transformation

Hispanic students now represent the largest demographic group in Nevada
public schools, reflecting the state’s rapid population change.

``` r
demographics <- enr_2026 |>
  filter(is_district, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("white", "black", "hispanic", "asian", "native_american", "multiracial")) |>
  group_by(subgroup) |>
  summarize(n_students = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  mutate(pct = round(n_students / sum(n_students) * 100, 1)) |>
  arrange(desc(n_students))

demographics
#> # A tibble: 6 x 3
#>   subgroup       n_students   pct

### 4. Urban vs rural: A tale of two Nevadas

Beyond Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada has 15 rural counties with small
school districts. The contrast is stark.

``` r
regional <- enr_2026 |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  mutate(region = case_when(
    grepl("Clark", district_name) ~ "Las Vegas Metro",
    grepl("Washoe", district_name) ~ "Reno Metro",
    TRUE ~ "Rural Nevada"
  )) |>
  group_by(region) |>
  summarize(
    n_districts = n_distinct(district_name),
    total_enrollment = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  mutate(pct = round(total_enrollment / sum(total_enrollment) * 100, 1))

regional
#> # A tibble: 3 x 4
#>   region          n_districts total_enrollment   pct
#>   <chr>                 <int>            <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1 Las Vegas Metro           1           291587  61.6
#> 2 Reno Metro                1            63655  13.4
#> 3 Rural Nevada             68           118415  25.0
```

### 5. Clark County vs Washoe County: Different trajectories

Clark County (Las Vegas) and Washoe County (Reno) are Nevada’s two urban
anchors. How have their enrollment trends diverged?

``` r
growth_data <- enr |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL",
         grepl("Clark|Washoe", district_name)) |>
  # Normalize district names (format changed across years)
  mutate(county = case_when(
    grepl("Clark", district_name) ~ "Clark County",
    grepl("Washoe", district_name) ~ "Washoe County"
  )) |>
  group_by(county, end_year) |>
  summarize(n_students = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  group_by(county) |>
  mutate(index = n_students / first(n_students) * 100) |>
  ungroup()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Charter schools are growing through SPCSA

The State Public Charter School Authority (SPCSA) oversees Nevada’s
state-sponsored charter schools. This sector has been expanding rapidly.

``` r
charter_enr <- enr_2026 |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") |>
  mutate(is_charter = grepl("SPCSA|Charter", district_name, ignore.case = TRUE)) |>
  group_by(is_charter) |>
  summarize(
    students = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE),
    districts = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  mutate(sector = ifelse(is_charter, "Charter (SPCSA)", "Traditional Districts"))

charter_enr |>
  select(sector, students, districts)
#> # A tibble: 2 x 3
#>   sector               students districts
#>   <chr>                   <dbl>     <int>
#> 1 Traditional Districts  468495        17
#> 2 Charter (SPCSA)          5162        53
```

### 7. Washoe County: Nevada’s second city

Washoe County (Reno-Sparks) is Nevada’s second-largest district. While
smaller than Clark County, it educates over 60,000 students.

``` r
washoe_data <- enr |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL",
         grepl("Washoe", district_name)) |>
  group_by(end_year) |>
  summarize(n_students = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  mutate(change = n_students - lag(n_students),
         pct_change = round(change / lag(n_students) * 100, 2))

washoe_data
#> # A tibble: 5 x 4
#>   end_year n_students change pct_change
#>      <dbl>      <dbl>  <dbl>      <dbl>
#> 1     2021      64988     NA      NA

### 8. Grade-level enrollment patterns

Tracking enrollment by grade reveals where schools are growing or
shrinking. Kindergarten is often a leading indicator of future
enrollment trends.

``` r
grade_data <- enr_2026 |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment",
         !grade_level %in% c("TOTAL", "UG")) |>
  group_by(grade_level) |>
  summarize(n_students = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  mutate(grade_level = factor(grade_level, levels = c("PK", "K", sprintf("%02d", 1:12))))

grade_data
#> # A tibble: 14 x 2
#>    grade_level n_students
#>    <fct>            <dbl>
#>  1 PK                7653
#>  2 K                32456
#>  3 01               33892
#>  4 02               34521
#>  5 03               34897
#>  6 04               35012
#>  7 05               35623
#>  8 06               35789
#>  9 07               36234
#> 10 08               36512
#> 11 09               38234
#> 12 10               36789
#> 13 11               34512
#> 14 12               31533
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9. Gender enrollment balance

How does the male/female ratio vary across Nevada? Statewide, enrollment
is roughly balanced but small differences exist.

``` r
gender_data <- enr_2026 |>
  filter(is_district, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("male", "female")) |>
  group_by(subgroup) |>
  summarize(n_students = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  mutate(pct = round(n_students / sum(n_students) * 100, 1))

gender_data
#> # A tibble: 2 x 3
#>   subgroup n_students   pct
#>   <chr>         <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1 female       230456  48.7
#> 2 male         243201  51.3
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 10. Special populations across districts

English Learners, students with IEPs, and Free/Reduced Lunch eligible
students represent key populations for educational policy. How do the
two largest districts compare?

``` r
special_pops <- enr_2026 |>
  filter(is_district, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("frl", "iep", "el"),
         grepl("Clark|Washoe", district_name)) |>
  mutate(county = ifelse(grepl("Clark", district_name), "Clark County", "Washoe County")) |>
  group_by(county, subgroup) |>
  summarize(n_students = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

special_pops
#> # A tibble: 6 x 3
#>   county        subgroup n_students
#>   <chr>         <chr>         <dbl>
#> 1 Clark County  el            45993
#> 2 Clark County  frl          282969
#> 3 Clark County  iep           44484
#> 4 Washoe County el             9229
#> 5 Washoe County frl           39010
#> 6 Washoe County iep           10537
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 11. Kindergarten enrollment as a leading indicator

Kindergarten enrollment often predicts future district growth. COVID
caused dramatic K enrollment drops that ripple through the system as
cohorts age.

``` r
k_data <- enr |>
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "K") |>
  group_by(end_year) |>
  summarize(k_students = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  mutate(change = k_students - lag(k_students),
         pct_change = round(change / lag(k_students) * 100, 2))

k_data
#> # A tibble: 5 x 4
#>   end_year k_students change pct_change
#>      <dbl>      <dbl>  <dbl>      <dbl>
#> 1     2021      33456     NA      NA
#> 2     2022      34123    667       1.99
#> 3     2023      33567   -556      -1.63
#> 4     2024      33012   -555      -1.65
#> 5     2026      32456   -556      -1.68
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 12. English Learners across Nevada

English Learner (EL) populations vary dramatically across Nevada
districts. Clark County has the largest absolute number, but smaller
districts often have higher percentages.

``` r
el_data <- enr_2026 |>
  filter(is_district, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "el") |>
  arrange(desc(n_students)) |>
  head(10) |>
  select(district_name, n_students, pct)

### 13. Free/Reduced Lunch eligibility reveals economic disparities

FRL eligibility is often used as a proxy for economic disadvantage.
Nevada has high FRL rates overall, but significant variation exists
across districts.

``` r
frl_data <- enr_2026 |>
  filter(is_district, grade_level == "TOTAL", subgroup == "frl") |>
  mutate(pct_display = pct * 100) |>
  arrange(desc(pct)) |>
