\dontrun{
# Get 2026 enrollment data (2025-26 school year)
enr_2026 <- fetch_enr(2026)

# Get wide format (one row per entity/grade)
enr_wide <- fetch_enr(2026, tidy = FALSE)

# Force fresh download (ignore cache)
enr_fresh <- fetch_enr(2026, use_cache = FALSE)

# Get multiple years
enr_multi <- purrr::map_df(c(2021:2024, 2026), fetch_enr)
