\title{Fetch Nevada school directory data}
\usage{
fetch_directory(end_year = NULL, tidy = TRUE, use_cache = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{end_year}{Currently unused. The directory data represents current
schools and is not year-specific. Included for API consistency with
other fetch functions.}

\item{tidy}{If TRUE (default), returns data in a standardized format with
consistent column names. If FALSE, returns raw column names from NDE.}

\item{use_cache}{If TRUE (default), uses locally cached data when available.
Set to FALSE to force re-download from NDE.}
}
\value{
A tibble with school directory data. Columns include:
\itemize{
\item \code{state_school_id}: NDE state school code
\item \code{state_district_id}: NDE master district code
\item \code{school_name}: School name
\item \code{school_type}: Type of school (e.g., "RG: Regular", "AL: Alternative")
\item \code{grades_served}: Grade levels offered (low to high)
\item \code{address}: Mailing address
\item \code{city}: City
\item \code{state}: State (always "NV")
\item \code{zip}: ZIP code
\item \code{phone}: Phone number
\item \code{principal_name}: Principal name
\item \code{principal_email}: Principal email address
\item \code{charter_status}: Charter indicator (YES/NO)
\item \code{operational_status}: Operational status
\item \code{website}: School website URL

\description{
Downloads and processes school directory data from the Nevada Department
of Education. This includes all public schools with contact information
and administrator names.
}
\details{
The directory data is downloaded as an Excel file from the NDE website.
This data represents the current state of Nevada schools and is updated
periodically by NDE.

Note: The directory file contains only school-level data. District
information is derived from the Master District Code.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get school directory data
dir_data <- fetch_directory()

# Get raw format (original NDE column names)
dir_raw <- fetch_directory(tidy = FALSE)

# Force fresh download (ignore cache)
dir_fresh <- fetch_directory(use_cache = FALSE)

# Filter to active schools only
library(dplyr)
active_schools <- dir_data |>
  filter(operational_status == "OP: Open")

# Find all charter schools
charters <- dir_data |>
  filter(charter_status == "YES")
